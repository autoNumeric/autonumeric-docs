AutoNumeric provides numerous methods to access and modify the element value, *formatted or unformatted*, at any point in time.
<br>It does so by providing access to those [methods](instantiated methods.md) via the AutoNumeric object class, which is declared as an ES6 Module.

First, you need to get a reference to the AutoNumeric module that you need to import:
```js title="Import the AutoNumeric library as an ES6 module"
import AutoNumeric from 'autonumeric';
```

Then you'll be able to access either the methods on the [instantiated](instantiated methods.md) AutoNumeric object, or the [static functions](static methods.md) directly by using the `AutoNumeric` class.
