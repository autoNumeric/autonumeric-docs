Projects have been created to integrate AutoNumeric in existing frameworks, so that the library could be used easily in components.

!!! Info
    Some of the following projects may lag with the latest AutoNumeric version, or even be incomplete.

## Javascript

For integration into Javascript frameworks, you can use:

- Vue.js with the [vue-autonumeric component](https://github.com/autoNumeric/vue-autoNumeric),
- React with the [react-autonumeric components](https://react-autonumeric.8hob.io/) (or [react-numeric component](https://github.com/mkg0/react-numeric) on an older version of react),
- Angular with the [@angularfy/autonumeric](https://github.com/angularfy/autonumeric),
- AngularJS with the [angular-currency](https://github.com/BuffCoder/angular-currency) directive,
- Meteor with [meteor-autonumeric](https://github.com/gibson/meteor-autonumeric), and
- Ember with [ember-autonumeric](https://github.com/ykaragol/ember-autonumeric).

## Rails

For integration into [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) projects, you can use the [autonumeric-rails](https://github.com/randoum/autonumeric-rails) project.

## PHP
For integration with [PHP](http://php.net/) Yii2, take a look at the [extead/yii2-autonumeric](https://github.com/extead/yii2-autonumeric) or [haifahrul/yii2-autonumeric](https://github.com/haifahrul/yii2-autonumeric) projects.
